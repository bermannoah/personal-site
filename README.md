# A personal profile site

At the moment, a pretty basic HTML/CSS landing page with some nifty animation effects. Hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet and provided with HTTPS by the wonderful [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).

You can see it in its current form [here](http://www.noahberman.org).

TODO:

- [x] Properly configure for a switch to a more configurable hosting solution.

- [x] Migrate domain, add HTTPS / Let's Encrypt cert.

- [ ] Figure out interesting or at least useful way to display projects.

- [ ] Improve the design while maintaining a low [web-bloat score](http://www.webbloatscore.com/).
